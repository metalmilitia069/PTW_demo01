  - Triple Shot Unlocked!
  - Diagonal Shot Unlocked!
  uiUnlockPanelContent:
  - Pilot, I just learned that by redirecting some power from the ship's  Reactor
    Core, I can provide extra energy to create additional bursts in form of projectiles.
    We can call it "Triple Shot" for obvious reasons, all you need to do is press
    "E" to switch fire modes. Be advised that some Enemies equipped shields that
    can block the Triple Shot's energy wave, therefore, if the enemy's shield's color
    is not BLUE, or if it does not match Triple Shot's color, you should probably
    switch to another fire mode. Have a Nice Hunt!
